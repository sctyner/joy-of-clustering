# The Joy of Clustering with Bob Ross

Code to create plots from [this post](http://www.statslife.org.uk/culture/2553-the-joy-of-clustering).  
This project was intially my final project in Stat 503 with Di Cook (@dicook) at Iowa State University in Spring 2015.
I then submitted a version of it to the YSS Writing Competition in Significance Magazine, and was a finalist. 

It was inspired by [Walt Hickey's similar post on FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/)
